\title{Generate a Heat Map}
\description{This package takes the original heatmap function and reduces the arguement complexity. A heat map is a false color image (basically image(t(x))) with a dendrogram added to the left side and to the top. Typically, reordering of the rows and columns according to some set of values (row or column means) within the restrictions imposed by the dendrogram is carried out.}

\details{
If either Rowv or Colv are dendrograms they are honored (and not reordered). Otherwise, dendrograms are computed as dd <- as.dendrogram(hclustfun(distfun(X))) where X is either x or t(x).

If either is a vector (of ‘weights’) then the appropriate dendrogram is reordered according to the supplied values subject to the constraints imposed by the dendrogram, by reorder(dd, Rowv), in the row case. If either is missing, as by default, then the ordering of the corresponding dendrogram is by the mean value of the rows/columns, i.e., in the case of rows, Rowv <- rowMeans(x, na.rm = na.rm). If either is NA, no reordering will be done for the corresponding side.

By default (scale = "row") the rows are scaled to have mean zero and standard deviation one. There is some empirical evidence from genomic plotting that this is useful.

The default colors are not used, instead the RColorBrewer package is used to enhance the colors. When adding personal colors to annotations, default colors or RColorBrewer colors are supported.

The "marray", micro array, package is used and installed through bioconductor. Full vignette and info found by entering: "browseVignettes("marray")" in RStudio.}
\value{
Invisibly, a list with components

rowInd
row index permutation vector as returned by order.dendrogram.

colInd
column index permutation vector.

Rowv
the row dendrogram; only if input Rowv was not NA and keep.dendro is true.

Colv
the column dendrogram; only if input Colv was not NA and keep.dendro is true.
}
\note{
Unless Rowv = NA (or Colw = NA), the original rows and columns are reordered in any case to match the dendrogram, e.g., the rows by order.dendrogram(Rowv) where Rowv is the (possibly reorder()ed) row dendrogram.

heatmap() uses layout and draws the image in the lower right corner of a 2x2 layout. Consequentially, it can not be used in a multi column/row layout, i.e., when par(mfrow = *) or (mfcol = *) has been called.
